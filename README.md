# DBC-testing

bash scripts to refine test procedures for community testnets

## DBC-baby-init.sh

The script will set up a baby-fleming local network, defaults to 20 nodes
create a keypair and wallet, then deposit the genesis DBC to the master wallet.  

## populate.sh

This wee script creates keypairs and wallets and saves the output to a json file.
Well it will when it is working properly ...
Intended to use the safe nrs command to create a network address for each account and store the keys and wallet address at a human-readable location on the SAFE network
